Case 2:

A client has reported difficulty in logging in despite providing the correct username and password combination.
In addition, when attempting to reset the password through the "Forgot password?" feature, they are not receiving the recovery email with the link.

Steps to resolve Case 2:

1. Client Verification:
   - Confirm the client's identity and gather necessary account information to ensure they are the rightful owner of the account.

2. Check System and Logs:
   - Review the system to ensure there are no technical issues affecting login functionality or password reset emails.
   - Check logs to identify any error messages or unusual activities related to the login or password reset processes.

3. Verify Email Configuration:
   - Confirm that the email service provider is functioning correctly and that emails are being sent out as expected.
   - Ensure there are no issues with the email templates, sending mechanism, or the domain's spam policies that could be causing emails not to be received.

4. Attempt Account Recovery:
   - Manually trigger a password reset for the client's account and confirm if they receive the recovery email.
   - If successful, guide the client on how to reset their password using the provided link.

5. Work with Relevant Teams:
   - Collaborate with the Backend Development Team to investigate any potential issues in the login and password reset processes within the application.
   - Engage the Frontend Development Team if there are potential interface-related issues affecting the login and password reset functionalities.

6. Feedback to Customer:
   - Keep the client informed of the progress and steps being taken to resolve the login and password reset issues.
   - Provide clear instructions and guidance to the client on any actions they need to take to recover their account.
